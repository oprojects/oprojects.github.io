# Abstract: ROOT - R interface
Provide a short (one paragraph) description of your proposal.  
**Description:** Develop an interface in ROOT to call R function using the R C++ interface (Rcpp, see http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html). As a proof of concept implement the Minimizer interface of ROOT to use a R package for minimization. Developing this interface opens the possibility in ROOT to use the very large set of mathematical and statistical tools provided by R.   
Implement C++ class(es) to perform a conversion of ROOT C++ object to R objects, transform the returned R objects into ROOT C++ objects.   
Expected Results: One or more C++ classes which perform the conversion of ROOT C++ object to R objects, able to call R functions and transform the returned R objects in ROOT C++ objects. The class(es) should implement some of the existing algorithm interface in ROOT, so that the R functionality can be used directly for fitting or statistical studies in ROOT.   
**Mentor:** Lorenzo Moneta   
**Requirements:** Basic knowledge of C++. Knowledge of ROOT and/or R would be advantages.  


# Application
Describe your application in detail. Provide some background, describe the work that you are expecting to do in the time leading to the GSoC start.  
**Basic Desing**  
![Basic Desing]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/GSoC2014ROOTRDesign.jpg)
I will create a library called libRInterface which will be in charge of communicationg ROOTwith R through RCpp and RInside packages(also based in RCpp).  

# Deliverables
What do you expect as a deliverable for your project? Please try to be as precise as you can (e.g. a ready to deploy package (or a patch) ABC implementing XYZ feature tested on Linux/Mac/Windows)  
Source Code in an repository that lets you use R in ROOT with the next features:  


1. **Classes TRInterface, TRFunction and TRObjectProxy:**
    1. With support to  pass  basic objects from ROOT like TArrays, TVectors and (if is posible TMatrix), with templates for Double_t, Float_t and Int_t  to R
    2. With support to  pass  objects from standard c++ like  std::vector, std::map, std::list, std::array with templates for Double_t, Float_t and Int_t  to R
    3. That lets you pass string values (char*, std::string, TString) and string arrays to R
    4. That lets parse R code and get the return value using std::vector,TVector, TArray,TString (or if is posible TMatrix).
    5. That lets you run functions passed from string (the string can have C-Functions if is posible).
    6. with operators overloaded for facilities.
    7. with support to run on root interpreter.
2. **Examples and tests codes:**
    1. An interpolation example passing points from ROOT to R and calling the R's interpolation functions, result will be plotted whit ROOT's TGraph class.
    2. Other basic examples calling some useful funtions of R
    3. test cases for every feature 
3. **Integrate to ROOT:**
    1. support for autotools and CMake
    2. support for Linux
    3. support for c++11
