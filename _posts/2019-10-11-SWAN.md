SWAN (Service for Web-based ANalysis) is CERN's Jupyter notebook service, giving access to data from EOS and CERNBox, software from CVMFS and connectivity to CERN Spark clusters.

The goal of this workshop is to share use cases among the community and for the SWAN team to learn in more detail how the service is used and how it should evolve to suit the usersâ€™ needs. <a href='https://indico.cern.ch/event/834069/'>https://indico.cern.ch/event/834069/</a>
