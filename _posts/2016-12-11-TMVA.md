Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis(TMVA) is a package in ROOT for machine learning algorithms for classification and regression of the events in the detectors. In TMVA, we are developing new high level algorithms to perform multivariate analysis as cross validation, hyper parameter optimization, variable importance etc... Almost all the algorithms are expensive and designed to process a huge amount of data. It is very important to implement the new technologies on parallel computing to reduce the processing times.
